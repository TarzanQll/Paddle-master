the device is cute , but that &apos;s just about all that &apos;s good. the specs are what you &apos;d expect : it &apos;s a wifi mic , with some noise filter options. the app has the option to upload your baby &apos;s name and photo , which is a cutesy touch. but the app is otherwise unstable and useless unless you upgrade for $ 60 / year.set up involves downloading the app , turning on the mic , switching your phone to the wifi network of the mic , telling the app your wifi settings , switching your wifi back to your home router. the app is then directly connected to your mic.the app is adware ! the main screen says &quot; cry notifications on / off : upgrade to evoz premium and receive a text message of email when your baby is crying &quot; .but the adware points out an important limitation , this monitor is only intended to be used from your home network. if you want to access it remotely , get a webcam. this app would make a lot more sense of the premium features were included with the hardware .
don &apos;t be fooled by my one star rating. if there was a zero , i would have selected it. this product was a waste of my money.it has never worked like the company said it supposed to. i only have one device , an iphone 4gs. after charging the the iphone mid way , the i.sound portable power max 16,000 mah is completely drained. the led light no longer lit up. when plugging the isound portable power max into a wall outlet to charge , it would charge for about 20-30 minutes and then all four battery led indicator lit up showing a full charge. i would leave it on to charge for the full 8 hours or more but each time with the same result upon using. don &apos;t buy this thing. put your money to good use elsewhere .
